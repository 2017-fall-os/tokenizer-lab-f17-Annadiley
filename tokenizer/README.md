## Tokenizer
-This lab tokenizers partition a character string into individual tokens (words) separated by reserved "delimiter characters".? In this case, the delimiter character is the space character and tokens contain any characters other than space characters.
## Special notes
-This lab uses the function strcopy that was used in the printDemo part of the project, with a couple of modification made to it.
## How to Run
-To create files, once in the directory type "make"
-To run the tokenizer type "make run"
-To clean *.o files, type "make clean"
